This repository contains the results of some of the experiments we carried out for the paper "The Simulation Semantics of Synthesisable Verilog" (OOPSLA'25):

- `interleave-tests` -- a small-scale systematic experiment on how much current Verilog simulators interleave procedural blocks
- `k-verilog` -- test modules for the Verilog semantics introduced by "[A Formal Executable Semantics of Verilog](https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMCOD.2010.5558634)"
- `lambda-verilog` -- test modules for the Verilog semantics introduced by "[The Essence of Verilog: A Tractable and Tested Operational Semantics for Verilog](https://doi.org/10.1145/3622805)"
